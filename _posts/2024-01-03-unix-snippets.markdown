- using `find` command to find files that contain both given strings
```
  find . -type f -exec grep -l 'string1' '{}' \; | xargs -d '\n' grep -l 'string2â€™
```

- to count occurrences
```
  find . -type f -name "*.java" | xargs grep -c Assert.assert | grep -v :0
```

- sed (from grymoire) -E ensures that '+' is considered as extended regexp 
```
  sed -E 's/([a-z]+) ([a-z]+)/\2 \1/'` # Using Apple Mac OS X
```

- One method of combining multiple commands is to use a -e before each command:
```
  sed -e 's/a/A/' -e 's/b/B/' <old >new
```

- jq (for json wrangling)
  sorts json blocks based on `key` variable
```
  jq '.values|=sort_by(.key)' local.postman_environment.json > local_updated
```
